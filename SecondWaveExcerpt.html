	<h1>Second Wave (excerpt)</h1>
	<h2>by Alexis Viera</h2>
	<p> The following morning, with her husband off for the day in search of new employment, and having walked her child to Mrs. Watson’s second grade class, Lilly found herself alone as usual in her hollow abode. She sat upon her floral sofa sorting through the Classifieds section of the day’s paper. Running her eyes breezily over the Personals, fabricating and unstitching the threads of romantic stories, of murderous tales and celebrity correspondence, communicated in public for all to observe and contribute fantastical notions, she reaches the portion of the paper dedicated to listing locally available employment opportunities. 
<br><br>
There was hardly a doubt she was among the most educated women in the region, having gone to college under the assumption she would never have the option to marry (only now did she note this to be a severely oppressive logical fallacy, remembering her time at the university as characterized by fierce peer appraisal aimed at the circumstances surrounding a woman’s enrollment.)  She had studied to become a teacher, and held a gig in a primary school in St. Mary’s county on Maryland’s westernmore tip. Her students all liked her tremendously, and were sadder to give her up to Dale, than she was to leave them at the time. Now, nostalgia and hindsight combined to ensure she could remember all their names and the precise way they were arranged in the classroom, staring up at her from their desks like suckling infants, reaching their hands up and out in thirst for all the wisdom Miss Lilly would offer them. Now that Dale was no longer a source of financial stability, her parents long dead, there was no reason she could not return to this past life and never come back. 
<br><br>
She ran her index finger softly along the surface of the page, over words that once held meaning but now are mere static, impertinent doodles on a page surrounding a gateway to perfect agency. What was a mechanic, an electrician, a plumber or physician but the cumulative result of competent educators, womanly labor summed to produce a brood of diligent wage earners, sustaining a progress driven society?
<br><br>
Tears formed beads in the corner of Lilly’s misshapen eyes, and she laughed a bit of the audacity of her thoughts, for it wasn’t even as if she had always aspired to become a teacher, but that university only allowed women that path, or else a career in nursing. The latter, though seemingly the more valiant choice, she was reddened to admit, petrified her to the core, since she could not so much as knit for her fear of needles, of puncturing precious skin, and she was shamed to capitulate to the notion of feminine fragility. But alas that grand snippet of time, the seven years Lilly spent nurturing a milky rationale in those suckling infants, had been a treasure, looted from her by a dismal pirate, which she had since become intent on recovering.
<br><br>
Moseying down the fifth column of listings, her finger froze upon an entry:
<br><br>
<b>
Ankle-Biter Care Center—Child Care Teacher Needed
Ankle-Biter Care Center is an independent Child Care Center located in Ancient Oaks, a quiet Lower Potomac neighborhood, and has been serving St. Mary’s County since 1914. We are looking for staff that are enthusiastic, energetic, responsible, reliable, team oriented person(s), who wish to work with children 1-5 years old. Interested and qualified persons may call Mr. Laurel Shillworth at (405) 914 – 8923 between the hours of 7 AM and 3 PM on business days. 
</b>
Marking the number down on an old handkerchief, Lilly called the number immediately to set up and arrange an appointment with Mr. Shillworth for the following day, her heart hammering from beginning to end as if it were the drum in a war march, whose troops’ advancement was solely guided by, its victory solely dependent upon the keeping of its steady rhythm.
<br><br>
Lilly fretted horribly over what would be asked of her during the interview, her mind splitting off into sensational directions as though they might demand she cite the most obscure document from French history, or perhaps a mathematical equation for making a perfectly golden pie. Although she recognized the roots of these unlikely scenarios in paranoia, she still paced within the confines of her patterned area rug, eyes not straying from her expressive hands as she practiced hypotheticals, feet fitting comfortably in the translucent oval shapes scattered and overlaid across the face of the rug to form a mesmerizing design she would not notice at all.
<br><br>
Having practiced for hours, Lilly started when she peered over for a moment at Dale’s wretched old grandfather clock to discover it was nearly 3 in the afternoon. She grabbed her worn overcoat from the closet and her dreariest brown half hat from the rack, before scurrying out to fetch her son from school, spending the walk twitching her lips in boredom trying to determine what she would make that night for dinner.

The following morning, Lily’s hands were so fidgety, she forgot to hold her son’s while crossing the street. She was halfway through the intersection when he called for her from his place on the corner of the sidewalk, gripping the street sign with a furious furrow of his brow for this sudden unprecedented neglect of his safety. He was so like his father, Lilly thought, giggling her way back to him.
<br><br>
When they reached his school, she watched him, waving as he scuttled inside, caught in the deluge of tired, reluctant learners of the morning hours. She stood before the grand doors of the institution, seas of students from the left and right parking lots converging right before her, like Moses watching the miracle of his Savior disintegrating before him, identifying him as a Chosen man. 
<br><br>
Are they the waves of the sea or the fish it harbors?, she wondered, gazing intently at the fluidity of the bobbing heads, messy and golden in the bright sunlight of the morning, resembling both reflection upon water and the scales of a dull rainbow trout. But certainly, they must be the waves, for time until the first bell was running slim, and their dance turned into the technique of a bore, two tides coursing swiftly to meet and crashing against the school (in the face of opposition), not far from its point of convergence.
<br><br>
Contentedness tugged at the right corner of her lips as she left for Ancient Oaks.
