Welcome.
Bienvenidos. 
Konichiwa.
You have been chosen to participate in the Game of Gods.
What is this, you ask?
Well. 
I have some big news for you.
You were all right.
Samuel, 
God is real — Player 1.
Aalim, 
Allah is real — Player 2.
Enmei, 
Your deities are real. 
(Although, they are slightly weaker) — Player 3.
All your gods are real. 
Big news, right?
But, 
there is also some bad news.
Humans are simulations.
The Gods like to play games, 
and you are their avatars.
When they say jump, you jump.
When they say duck, you duck.
When they say fight, you fight. (That is, to the death of course.)
And—
you must listen carefully now— 
when they say die, you must die.
It’s imperative you don’t forget that one.
Good?
Great!
Just to be clear, 
when you die, you will return to where you came from.
That is — nothing.
Are we clear?
Fantastic!
Everyone, get ready now.
Life on the Planet Earth can be pretty tricky now that you know, 
and there are many rules to follow.
The most important rules are:
Rule 1: You must always put yourself, and your God, first.
Rule 2: You must avoid, whenever possible, making alliances with others.
Rule 3: You must always, always, try to win.
Your Gods trust you know these rules well.
Your Gods chose you for your skill.
Do not let your Gods down, men.
Remember, their will prevails.
Are you ready?
Your game will begin in 5.
