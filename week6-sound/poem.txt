Perhaps the quickest route from here to there
is a thoughtless, speechless endeavor,
a cobblestone grid with diminutive variation.
Perhaps you can close your eyes,
faux meditation, you call it,
and be guided - blind - to the terminus
you are waiting to mark as home
with an ink leaking invisible
until reality sets in and you aren’t touching pen
to paper.
And the space betwixt is the result of a memory,
the only crevice in a world so foreign 
with an understanding of your being,
so that any avenue to the terminus must be
nothing shy of insufferable.
And you think "perhaps the quickest route from here to there -
the thoughtless and mindless endeavor -
is the only one I can endure,”
and thereby embark
with a mind so disinclined 
to unknowingly fill the track of your Odyssean life. 
But a rebel you are -
or maybe less a rebel than a fellow
uninterested in boredom -
open your eyes to the foreign world,
to the teal of zeal and pacifism,
the canary of an absolute acumen,
and ruby of a heinous yet conquerable evil.
And you think “perhaps the quickest route from here to there
does no justice to the odyssey,”
and dare not blink for all your existence
for fear of missing a single instance of pulse and possibilities.
