\f0\fs26 \cf0 If I had a nickel for every time I\'92ve cried in the back of an Uber, I would have another pair of Yeezy\'92s. Just stare in the mirror and cry and you\'92ll be good. That moment when you\'92re wearing a dress with no pants and you swerve way too hard. That moment when you \'93whip\'94 so hard, you tear a ligament in your neck. I saw Owen Wilson one tine from a distance and we just stared at each other, then his car drove off. Shia Labeouf is life. Kanye for president. I walked into an Adidas store and asked for some Yeezy Boosts and they said I was 10 months late. Kanye West is the greatest dancer of our generation. Yea your girl is bad but she doesn\'92t smile. When you stop texting her cause you like her too much. Relationships are messed up but your face isn\'92t. That moment when peeing feels so good you start crying. Home is any place that has a bed, a TV, and you. Hard work, dedication until there\'92s peace and non poverty in every nation, and I isn\'92t patient. Shouts out to everybody that copped the new pants, I\'92m in sewing class today, so that next level is coming soon. \'93Jaden, where can we expect you to be in 5 years?\'94 \'93Gone.\'94 Just finished building my new bed. All of your idols are going to start writing their own articles, and these uninformed \'93journalists" will become obsolete. I really dislike when all the pretty girls hangout at once, cause I\'92m never there. I\'92m gunna be so hype on stage tomorrow I might throw up. I never realized how dysfunctional a king is without a queen. Balance is key. Don\'92t become attached cause then you disconnect and once you gather stress you\'92ll be obsessed with flip in checks. \'93Jaden, Jaden, let me twerk on you ONE time.\'94 Things we say at Coachella. \'93Every rich kid has a Sweet 16 so why didn\'92t we hear about Jaden\'92s?\'94 OHH wait he didn\'92t have one! Yea whatever you\'92re still not as cool as North. Instagram is a black hole of time and energy. Instagram is not the answer. That moment when you can\'92t sleep so you start doing math. When life gives you big problems, just be happy you forgot all your little problems. People think they have to choose. I don\'92t smell good, but I don\'92t smell bad you feel me. People tell me I\'92m an old soul, but I will be young forever. Omg I\'92m about to tweet the most Jaden Smith thing ever ready? The more time you spend awake the more time you spend asleep. Christian Grey. Yeah yeah, but how many pull ups can you do? When you party I\'92m on the treadmill. When you sleep I\'92m on the treadmill. When I tweet I\'92m on the treadmill. Remember this. A little girl just asked me if I was Willow Smith I humbly said yes and took a selfie. There is no dress. What is the definition of \'93light\'94? Next time in the movie look at the guy that says \'93I\'92ll never leave you\'94 and watch what happens directly after. God bless the media. If we didn\'92t have it, who would you judge to make yourself feel better? The grass is always greener on the other side, so stay over there, would ya? I don\'92t know if last night was a dream or not. Whenever you disagree with somebody just remember The Dress and accept that you guys are SEEING two different things. All I\'92m gunna do when I get my license is drive by my x\'92s house REAL SLOW. Tweets are like tattoos. You would have to eat 5 apples today to get the same nutritional value as an apple from 1950. I don\'92t want you guys to think because I was born in America that I speak and abide by English Grammar. I speak Jaden, indefinitely. Me, you, and Willow should look at tress together. If a cupcake falls from a tree how far away will it be from down. Jupiter. If everybody in the world dropped out of school we would have a much more intelligent society. You can discover everything you need to know about everything by looking at your hands. People used to ask me what do you wanna be when you get older and I would say What a stupid question. The real question is what am I right now. If a book store never runs out of a certain book, does that mean that nobody reads it, or everybody reads it? How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren\'92t real If newborn babies could speak they would be the most intelligent beings on Planet Earth. Trees are never sad. Look at them every once in awhile, they\'92re quite beautiful. There is no nutrients in our food anymore or in our soil OR IN OUR WATER. People tell me to smile I tell them the lack of emotion in my face doesn\'92t mean I\'92m unhappy. People think a relationship makes you whole. That it\'92s two 50%s coming together to make 100% when it should be two 100%s making 200%. When you live your whole life in a prison freedom can be so dull. All the rules in this world were made by someone no smarter than you. So make your own. You think you get it. YOU DON\'92T YOU DON\'92T YOU DON\'92T!!!!!!!! Most trees are blue. The biggest flex anyone will ever have is dying. Can I really bring the essence through these dinging lessons and Google Ping Investments? The moment that truth is organized it becomes a lie. \'93Hey are you Jaden can I have a picture with you?\'94 No cause I\'92m super sad but we can sit and talk. Every 7 years your body is completely replaced with entirely new cells so just because you look the same doesn\'92t mean you are. Dear The Internet, have fun with that. \'93It\'92s your birthday\'94 Mateo said. I didn\'92t respond. \'93Are you not excited to be 15?\'94 He asked. Reading my book I uttered, \'93I turned 15 long ago.\'94 Currently going through customs even though I was born on this Planet. Don\'92t worry bae, I\'92ll talk to you about SpaceTime over FaceTime. They distract you with us so you don\'92t pay attention to the missing girls in Nigeria. Teleport to me. Jealousy just reassures your love. You do not know who you are or why you\'92re here so when you see someone who does, the society comes together as a whole and destroys them. To the artists of this coming generation and of the Renaissance. The people that truly understand your art are the people who don\'92t comment. I encourage you all to unfollow me so I can be left with the people who actually appreciate philosophy and poetry. We need to stop teaching the youth about the past and encourage them to change the future. I should just stop tweeting, the human consciousness must raise before I speak my juvenile philosophy. The Great Gatsby is one of the greatest movies of all time, Coachella. Everybody get off your phones and go do what you actually wanna do. Education is rebellion. School is the tool to brainwash the youth. I honestly love when people hate even when they\'92re close to you. I\'92ll never forget the blogs that believed in me since The Begging. I only apply to the Sixth Amendment. I will always give you the truth. I will never lie to you in my music. If you can\'92t handle my feelings and emotions please unfollow me. Why is always 3? WHY IS IT ALWAYS 3!!!!!! Lately people call me Scoop Life. I watch Twilight every night. Umm who has the floss? I\'92m 13, this is ridiculous. People hate what they don\'92t understand.\'a0
\f1\fs28 \cf2 I think that there is that special equation for everything, but I dont think our mathematics have evolved enough for us to even \'97 I think theres, like, a whole new mathematics that wed have to learn to get that equation ... Its beyond mathematical. Its, like, multidimensional mathematical, if you can sort of understand what Im saying.\'a0I wore the Batman suit to heighten my experience at the wedding and prom which was fun, but also at the wedding I felt as though I needed to protect everyone there and needed to have the proper gear to do so. My style icons are Batman, Robin, Nightwing, Superman, and Kanye West.\'a0Since were family, we both have wins, and we dont really go against each other, like, Im gonna kill you.\'92\'a0Went to TopShop to buy some girl clothes, I mean\'a0\'91clothes.\'92 Dying is\'a0mainstream #MONEY.\'a0
\f0\fs26 \cf0 Man Im sorry, I aint eat today cause I didnt know what I should eat today. Full or hungry, dont know what the difference is. I just hope we work out all our differences cause I be flyin where them pigeons is. Buffy is life, thank you guys.\'a0
\f1\fs28 \cf2 The thing that people dont get is everything at this house is free. So I can get anything and everything at his house, so Im going to be there 20, 30 more years.\'a0Everything that I talk about in my music is pretty much just trying to evolve consciousness in the world and help everything become better and brighter.\'a0So when one thought goes into your mind, its not just one thought, it has to bounce off both hemispheres of the brain. When youre thinking about something happy, youre thinking about something sad. When you think about an apple, you also think about the opposite of an apple. Its a tool for understanding mathematics and things with two separate realities. But for creativity: That comes from a place of oneness. Thats not a duality consciousness. And you cant listen to your mind in those times \'97 itll tell you what you think and also what other people think.\'a0And everything you say is something that you cant reverse / Something that you cant rehearse. Either I lie to you or we cry together. Idgaf I love her. Michael Cera please help me finish my album. Today, tomorrow, always. If two vegetarians are arguing\'85 is it still considered beef? Anything you see in any magazine ever is fake. And I met her blow dealer. He told me he was a whole seller. Man, I met a girl at Coachella. I like her but you know I couldn\'92t tell her cause she has her own fella. Young Jaden: Here\'92s the deal. For every time out you give me, you\'92ll give me 15 dollars for therapy when I get older. Everyone knows I\'92m a ghost. If there is breadwinners, there is\'a0breadlosers. But you can\'92t toast what isn\'92t real. I just decided to become a DJ. Hit me up for gigs. You could move in to Hidden Hills and we still don\'92t live by the same code. I\'92m tryna save the world and get out. If a song of mine drops and it\'92s not on my Twitter or iTunes that means I didn\'92t want it out. My Cartier rings are starting to hit me in my face. I can\'92t even walk around outside with my best friends and enjoy myself anymore unless I\'92m in the mountains where I belong. Hello google, how are you? It\'92s been awhile since we last spoke. They gone leave you when you down not when you up. I just sneezed so hard my grill came out. America: A living, breathing nightmare on infinite loop. Fake ice on my wrist man, I\'92m Frio. Take a pair of parables and tear em up for your damn poetry. Embarrass us. They tried to steal my vision, this ain\'92t a culture, this my religion.\'a0}
