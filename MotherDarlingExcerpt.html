	<h1>Mother Darling (excerpt)</h1>
	<h2>by Alexis Viera</h2>
	<p> In preparing to trail the two, she turns on the radio for the first time in years, warding off bizarre, impossible, thoughts of suburban lagoons, secluded, untouched for decades and ripe to undertake a new, fresh body, young and sweet for the native creatures, with saxophone riffs and scatting. She tries her hand at—bap ba doo blue lagoon dooby doo bap ta glass glass shin booba doy my baby boy doo wap doo wap doo wap crap crap—singing along with the nonsense, but such absurdities, she knows, flourish in a clear mind where they can grow organically from the very convolutions of the brain, expanding to fill the space with sounds one can gather at random, with ease, without the firmly rooted weeds of unyielding thought to threaten its erratic development. Two cars behind the old minivan at all times, she drives rather mechanically, routine prompting her feet to the pedals, preferring instead to direct every ounce of her awareness to scatting the correct nonsensical syllables as if precise execution transforms it into Shakespearean tragedy, which she must perform to a tee or otherwise risk being slain on stage by history, if not by the poison of impeccably launched rotten tomatoes, if not by the rigged rigid blade of her co-star’s sword. Time, landscape, and anxiety all pass in this way. Her vehicle drills through the pall of nighttime, impenetrable via the naked eye, broken in beams to reveal massive emptiness, unsettlingly heavy, sloshing over stagnant bile, which she notes is not meant to be stagnant, but, yes, certainly it all lay dormant, becoming increasingly viscous as it integrates with the violent nothingness. It is a spell, she broods, like he has clipped the cord of my autonomy and is taunting me with my own child, leading me to my doom with the ultimate bait, as if I were a flounder in love with the minnow on the hook, or perhaps a rodent whose dearest friend was the block of cheddar cheese in the fridge. Just as the metaphor is evolving in her mind, inducing her to squeak in place of the failed attempts at scatting, the old minivan veers suddenly to the right, entering a well concealed parking lot. She turns off her headlights, wielding the pall as a shawl, an artful masquerade and, she feels, display of dominance over her circumstance—this strange aperture, a flat opening inserted into a localized countryside, a branch of the suburb, she thinks, I must have passed a million times over without wandering into. The building for which all the greenery parts is a hospital; she could tell by the familiar dull drone of its mechanical orchestra. And she sits there and watches as her child is flung once more over the shoulder of her ex-husband, as if he were not in some moments to walk into a professional establishment where he must act properly, must quell the vermin that lives in him, that so often demonstrates its dominance over him like a termite—unfed for ages on end, not knowing how to ration a bounty—plaguing Pinocchio. (That is, before he met The Fairy With Turquoise Hair.)  She often feels that was her role—humanizer—feels she made him a real man capable of fathering and feels the weight of all she has done for him settle over her, first in the form of a blanket woven by nostalgia, but quickly converting, when juxtaposed to his transgressions towards her, to a cloud of unabashed rage, turquoise in color. This perverted vignette of father and son, aggressor and victim, clear as day to she who knows them best, soon recedes from view, and she allows her rage to guide her. Free from the perils of discovery at last, she does not falter to move in immediately, allowing herself to walk to the hospital doors in her old gait—uncrouched, chin raised, self-assured. It feels unnatural, crude even, but she would have to relearn the act of walking itself, the agreed upon, understandable version of walking if she was to be a mother again, with all the responsibilities of a mother, all the guidance she is obliged to her flock, so on she carries her awkward stroll, avoiding stepping on the grid of white lines, recalling an old fable of the trials and tribulations that might befall one if one should misstep, not necessarily believing in it but neither wanting to jeopardize this fragile advantage. The hospital’s emblem is brandished, large but nonthreatening, featuring a crayon—Sickly Green, she thought, with a tart chuckle—on the wall she faces upon entering, over which the name, St. Hubert, is arranged in a delicate font, like the measured calligraphy of the original Bible might have appeared if it were written in the Latin alphabet. She feels the impulse to kneel before the name, not knowing why (she is Jewish, after all), but nevertheless she sends lengthy, pleading prayers to St. Hubert to protect her son and bring him back to her. St. Hubert, she does not know, is only the patron saint of foresters and could have no say on the matter.
